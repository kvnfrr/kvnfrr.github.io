<p>
  My name is Kevin Ferrer, a Computer Science student at Florida International
  University, graduating around Fall 2026. I got into coding pretty early
  because I genuinely could not get away from the computer. Whether it was taking apart
  my old laptops or tinkering with game files (totally not for cheating), it was all too interesting. Naturally, I ended up pursuing computer science. Going from
  typing <code>sv_cheats 1</code> into a console to building full apps over a weekend.
</p>

<p>
  Of course, programming can only do so much on its own, so I branched out
  and found ways to connect my extremely "junior–almost-senior–definitely ancient
  10,000+ year entry-level" coding skills to the real world, mostly through AWS.
</p>

<p>
  Point being: I like knowing whats happening. Which means seeing things work across the whole stack. From my code
  to the user’s screen and everything in between.

<p>
  The way I work is mostly what you’d expect: talk with the team, understand
  the problem, loop in the lead, make things happen, repeat. 
  But one thing stands out, and I put a lot of emphasis on documentation.
</p>

<p>
  You’d be surprised how many college projects I’ve had where the codebase
  had zero context clues, no comments, no docs. Holy awesome, right?
  Nothing like spending an afternoon looking through a repo.
</p>

<p>
  For real though, everything I do is written down. What it does, how to
  use it, how to adjust it, what it depends on. This habit has saved me more
  times than I’d like to admit, and honestly, I’m proud of it.
  Confluence might actually be a miracle.

<p><strong>The tools of the trade — the stuff I actually use.</strong></p>

<p>
  For languages, Java is where I’m most comfortable, with Python and C being
  my go-tos for scripting or low level tasks. And of course, for
  web dev, the trio: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
</p>

<p><strong>Languages I work with:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Java</li>
  <li>Python (scripting)</li>
  <li>C</li>
  <li>HTML / CSS / JavaScript</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Frameworks & tools I’ve used:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Astro (used to make this website)</li>
  <li>React</li>
  <li>Node.js</li>
  <li>Spring Boot</li>
  <li>PostgreSQL</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cloud experience:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>AWS (EC2, S3, IAM, EventBridge, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Overall, I like a bit of everything. Mainly I specialize in Java development and typical workflow automation / process wiring for simplicity.
  Always looking to learn something new, especially if you don't mind a waterfall of questions.

              At BankUnited I joined the Cloud & DevOps team, and worked on the less glamorous, but very important, parts of keeping servers healthy. 
              It consisted mainly of joining in on team meetings, understanding the work flow (they recently moved from a physical data center to the cloud), and collaborating with mentors.
              Here, I had the oppertunity to design an event driven EC2 monitoring pipeline using EventBridge, SNS, and CloudWatch. 
              Even getting to validate security tag for production software the bank uses daily in AWS.
            </p>
            <p>
              Getting to explore the BankUnited teams that keep things running was genuinely a cool experience. 
              Huge props to the people there, especially our mentors, who made sure we walked away with more than just technical knowledge, 
              but with the communication and relationship building skills every college student needs.

  City of Coral Gables was my first real-world experience in the workforce. 
  During the interview, I walked in on my (soon-to-be) boss, Mark Herbert 
  (the GIS Manager and a very smart guy) surrounded by scattered PC parts. 
  After quick introductions, he told me my first “test” was to fix it. 
  It felt like a skit, but I couldn’t say no.
</p>

<p>
  With some Google magic and a blinking light clue, we figured out 
  the CMOS battery was dead. Swapping one from another machine brought the PC 
  back to life, and apparently that was enough to earn my spot on the team.
</p>

<p>
  The environment there was great. Casual conversations, plenty of learning, 
  and a surprisingly interesting challenge. Build a system to transcribe phone 
  calls and help users troubleshoot basic issues, especially non-native English 
  speakers who often had to repeat themselves.
</p>

<p>
  Outside of that project, I handled the usual flow of hardware/software tickets 
  any city i.t. would receive and documented everything so the next intern didn’t have to start from scratch.
