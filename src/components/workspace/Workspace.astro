<p>
  My name is Kevin Ferrer, a Computer Science student at Florida International
  University, graduating around Fall 2026. I got into coding pretty early
  because I genuinely could not get away from the computer. Whether it was taking apart
  my old laptops or tinkering with game files (totally not for cheating), it was all too interesting. Naturally, I ended up pursuing computer science. Going from
  typing <code>sv_cheats 1</code> into a console to building full apps over a weekend.
</p>

<p>
  Of course, programming can only do so much on its own, so I branched out
  and found ways to connect my extremely "junior–almost-senior–definitely ancient
  10,000+ year entry-level" coding skills to the real world, mostly through AWS.
</p>

<p>
  Point being: I like knowing whats happening. Which means seeing things work across the whole stack. From my code
  to the user’s screen and everything in between.

<p>
  The way I work is mostly what you’d expect: talk with the team, understand
  the problem, loop in the lead, make things happen, repeat. 
  But one thing stands out, and I put a lot of emphasis on documentation.
</p>

<p>
  You’d be surprised how many college projects I’ve had where the codebase
  had zero context clues, no comments, no docs. Holy awesome, right?
  Nothing like spending an afternoon looking through a repo.
</p>

<p>
  For real though, everything I do is written down. What it does, how to
  use it, how to adjust it, what it depends on. This habit has saved me more
  times than I’d like to admit, and honestly, I’m proud of it.
  Confluence might actually be a miracle.

<ul>
  <li>- Java</li>
  <li>- Python (mostly scripting)</li>
  <li>- C</li>
  <li>- HTML / CSS / JavaScript</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Java is defintely where I’m most at home. I can build quickly, structure things cleanly,
  and get into a flow state without overthinking it. Python and C are solid for me
  as well, especially for scripting, automation, and even some lower-level problem solving.
</p>

<p>
  Framework and tooling experience includes React, Node.js, Spring Boot,
  PostgreSQL, and AWS (which includes EC2, S3, IAM, EventBridge, DRS, and friends).
</p>

<p>
  Broadly speaking, I lean towards development (programming), but still appreciate where cloud infrastructure meets software.
  Allowing me to automate workflows, wire services together, and so on.

              At BankUnited I joined the Cloud & DevOps team and worked on the less glamorous,
              but very important, parts of keeping servers healthy.
              I designed an event-driven EC2 monitoring pipeline using EventBridge, SNS, and CloudWatch
              so alerts weren’t tied to someone staring at a dashboard.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also helped validate disaster recovery setups for more than twenty production workloads using AWS DRS and backups.
              A lot of the work was about asking “what happens if this fails?” and then making sure the answer wasn’t “we guess.”

              At the City of Coral Gables I sat closer to the end users.
              I helped a team of three build Python scripts to transcribe phone calls,
              which made it easier for non-native English speakers to troubleshoot issues without repeating themselves.

            <p>
              Outside of that, I handled a steady stream of hardware and software tickets

              FaceCert AI is a facial-recognition login system I built with FaceAPI.js and a Spring Boot backend.

              The fun part here was treating it like a real service: modularizing the backend,

              We used the ChatGPT API to enrich recipe data for 50+ countries and added 3D recipe visuals with Three.js.
